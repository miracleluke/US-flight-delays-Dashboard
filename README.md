# US-flight-delays-Dashboard
*In this Project, I created visualizations to reveal insights from US Flight delays dataset. This dataset is from a kaggle dataset that tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015.
*I created visualizations, dashboard and stories using Tableau that showed which flights travelled the longest distance, the number of departure delays for each airline and the number of cancelled flights for each airlines.
*I created a Pdf file where I added links to my visualizations and the reason i used each type of visualization and colour scheme.
